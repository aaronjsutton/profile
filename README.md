# Profile

`profile` - change terminal profiles

The missing command for macOS. Set your terminal profile from the comfort of your
very own shell. A fade function

## Installation
Clone this repo, and source the script with a line similar to:

```
  source /your/path/to/profile.sh
```

in your `$HOME/.bashrc` or `$HOME/.zshrc`

### Customizing Behaviour

To customize `profile`, define the following environment variables before you
`source ... profile.sh`:

- `$_PROFILE_NOFADE`: disable terminal background transitions, defaults to `0`.
- `$_PROFILE_CMD`: alias that points to the profile function, defaults to `profile`.
- `$_PROFILE_SCRIPT_LIBRARY`: path OSA script file that contains bindings for manipulating 
the terminal environment. You probably won't need to change this unless you are working with
the source.

## Usage

**On the first run**, the command may take several seconds to generate a cache of your profiles.

Set the profile named "cobalt2":

```
  profile -s cobalt2
```

List available profiles:

```
  profile -l
```

Clear the profile cache:

```
  profile -x
```

Use the `-x` flag any time you install or remove profiles from your Terminal.
