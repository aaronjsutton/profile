 * OSA Script functions for terminal command bindings.
 *
 * This library exposes a few useful functions that bridge the
 * gap between the shell environment and actions normally accessible
 * via Open Scripting Architecture. The aim is modularize tasks from
 * as much as possible, to expose a thin surface layer for interacting
 * with the user's terminal application from a better environment.
 *
 * Most of the scarce documentation found for putting this together comes
 * from OS X 10.10 JXA Release Notes. There are a couple of quirks and oddities
 * about the way this code is implemented, so consult the docs carefully.

 * Run handler for the Profile library.
 * JXA has little support for any library/modularity functionality,
 * so the purpose of this run handler will be to enable communication with
 * JXA using a small and simple "command language", passing data in via arguments, and out
 * via `osascript`'s return value. Until someone finds a better way to do this,
 * the primary method for calling out to JXA functions will be through the `osascript`
 * binary. For example, set a profile named 'cobal2' from a shell script:
 *
 *  osascript -l JavaScript Profile.scpt set cobal2
 *
 * Execute a command by passings arguments to the script. The first argument is the command
 * itself, and any following arguments will be passing along to the command function.
 * Commands available are documented above.
